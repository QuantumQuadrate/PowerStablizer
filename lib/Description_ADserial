Currently in our project we are using an Arduino to do the ADC. This library can help RPi interact with the AD serial port.

serial baudrate=9600
serial portname='/dev/ttyACM0'

flush():flush the input stack.
rd(): read data from serial port
seropen(): open the serial port
serclose(): close the serial port
datastoi(x): convert the result from rd() to a interger.
