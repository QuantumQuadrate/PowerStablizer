This library can help make the raspberry pi controller communicate to the rotating mount.
The following functions might be usefulï¼š

setup():Initialize the serial port. Successfull intilization will return 0.
home():Home the motor.
getpos():Get the current position of the motor.
moveabs(x):Make the motor rotate to an absolute position x(0-360).
moverel(x):Make the motor rotate by a relative angle x(-360-360).

All the moving commands will have a returned byte string containing information of the system.

Additional functions can be developed to set the motor's velocity, acceleration, etc. For now these basic operations are enough to test the functionality of the system.
