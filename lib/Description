This library can help make the raspberry pi controller communicate to the rotating mount.
The following functions might be usefulï¼š

setup():Initialize the serial port. Successfull intilization returns 0.
home():Home the motor.
getpos():Get the current position of the motor.
moveabs(x):Make the motor rotate to an absolute position x(0-360).
moverel(x):Make the motor rotate by a relative angle x(-360-360).

Additional functions can be developed to set the motor's velocity, acceleration, etc. For now these basic operations are enough to test the functionality of the system.
